  Workshop Motivation

  Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Software Productivity, Sustainability, and Quality (SPSQ) Interagency Working Group are partnering on this workshop, to inform a community strategy for building and maintaining U.S. leadership in software engineering and AI engineering , and positively impact progress in multiple application domains.


  Work on software engineering and AI engineering continues to receive increasing attention. This workshop intends to build on prior successful events to explore these issues in diverse application domains and address broader interests of the participating organizations. Using Architecting the Future of Software Engineering: A National Agenda for Software Engineering Research and Development as a starting point, we will identify and explore important research areas for the future of software engineering that are critical for multidisciplinary research. We will spur new partnerships to enable collaborations to advance the disciplines of software and AI engineering.
