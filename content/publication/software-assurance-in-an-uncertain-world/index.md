  From financial services platforms to social networks to vehicle control,
  software has come to mediate many activities of daily life. Governing bodies
  and standards organizations have responded to this trend by creating
  regulations and standards to address issues such as safety, security and
  privacy. In this environment, the compliance of software development to
  standards and regulations has emerged as a key requirement. Compliance claims
  and arguments are often captured in assurance cases, with linked evidence of
  compliance. Evidence can come from testcases, verification proofs, human
  judgment, or a combination of these. That is, experts try to build
  (safety-critical) systems carefully according to well justified methods and
  articulate these justifications in an assurance case that is ultimately judged
  by a human. Yet software is deeply rooted in uncertainty; most complex
  open-world functionality (eg, perception of the state of the world by a
  self-driving vehicle), is either not completely specifiable or it is not
  cost-effective to do so; software systems are often to be placed into
  uncertain environments, and there can be uncertainties that need to be We
  argue that the role of assurance cases is to be the grand unifier for software
  development, focusing on capturing and managing uncertainty. We discuss three
  approaches for arguing about safety and security of software under
  uncertainty, in the absence of fully sound and complete methods: assurance
  argument rigor, semantic evidence composition and applicability to new kinds
  of systems, specifically those relying on ML.
