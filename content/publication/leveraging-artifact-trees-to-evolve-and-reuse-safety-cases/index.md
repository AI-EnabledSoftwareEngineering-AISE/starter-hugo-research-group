abstract: Safety Assurance Cases (SACs) are increasingly used to guide and
  evaluate the safety of software-intensive systems. They are used to construct
  a hierarchically organized set of claims, arguments, and evidence in order to
  provide a structured argument that a system is safe for use. However, as the
  system evolves and grows in size, a SAC can be difficult to maintain. In this
  paper we utilize design science to develop a novel solution for identifying
  areas of a SAC that are affected by changes to the system. Moreover, we
  generate actionable recommendations for updating the SAC, including its
  underlying artifacts and trace links, in order to evolve an existing safety
  case for use in a new version of the system. Our approach, Safety Artifact
  Forest Analysis (SAFA), leverages traceability to automatically compare
  software artifacts from a previously approved or certified version with a new
  version of the system. We identify, visualize, and explain changes in a Delta
  Tree. We evaluate our approach using the Dronology system for monitoring and
  coordinating the actions of cooperating, small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
  Results from a user study show that SAFA helped users to identify changes that
  potentially impacted system safety and provided information that could be used
  to help maintain and evolve a SAC.
