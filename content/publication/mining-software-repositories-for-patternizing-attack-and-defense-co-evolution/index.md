abstract: Several evidence indicates that malicious cyber actors learn, adapt,
  or, in other words, react to the defensive measures put into place by the
  cybersecurity community, as much as system defenders react to attacks. To this
  end, this research aims to mine the existing software repositories to document
  patterns of co-evolution, which appear between the cyber attacker and
  defender, as attack-and defend adaptations, for the purpose of determining the
  probability of attackersâ€™ responsive actions.
