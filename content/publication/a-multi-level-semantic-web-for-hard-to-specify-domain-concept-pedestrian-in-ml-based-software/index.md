abstract: "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely used in building
  software-intensive systems, including safety-critical ones. Unlike traditional
  software components, Machine-Learned Components (MLC)s, software components
  built using ML algorithms, learn their specifications through generalizing the
  common features that they find in a limited set of collected examples. While
  this inductive nature overcomes the limitations of programming hard-to-specify
  concepts, the same feature becomes problematic for verifying safety in
  ML-based software systems. One reason is that, due to MLCs data-driven nature,
  there is often no set of explicitly written and pre-defined specifications,
  against which the MLC can be verified. In this regard, we propose to partially
  specify hard-to-specify domain concepts, which MLCs tend to classify, instead
  of fully relying on their inductive learning ability from
  arbitrarily-collected datasets. In this paper, we propose a semi-automated
  approach to construct a multi-level semantic web to partially outline the
  hard-to-specify, yet crucial, domain concept “pedestrian” in automotive
  domain. We evaluate the applicability of the generated semantic web in two
  ways: first, with a reference to the web, we augment a pedestrian dataset for
  a missing feature, wheelchair, to show training a state-of-the-art ML-based
  object detector on the augmented dataset improves its accuracy in detecting
  pedestrians; second, we evaluate the coverage of the generated semantic web
  based on multiple state-of-the-art pedestrian and human datasets."
