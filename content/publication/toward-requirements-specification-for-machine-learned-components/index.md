abstract: In current practice, the behavior of Machine-Learned Components (MLCs)
  is not sufficiently specified by the predefined requirements. Instead, they
  "learn" existing patterns from the available training data, and make
  predictions for unseen data when deployed. On the surface, their ability to
  extract patterns and to behave accordingly is specifically useful for
  hard-to-specify concepts in certain safety critical domains (e.g., the
  definition of a pedestrian in a pedestrian detection component in a vehicle).
  However, the lack of requirements specifications on their behaviors makes
  further software engineering tasks challenging for such components. This is
  especially concerning for tasks such as safety assessment and assurance. In
  this position paper, we call for more attention from the requirements
  engineering community on supporting the specification of requirements for MLCs
  in safety critical domains. Towards that end, we propose an approach to
  improve the process of requirements specification in which an MLC is developed
  and operates by explicitly specifying domain-related concepts. Our approach
  extracts a universally accepted benchmark for hard-to-specify concepts (e.g.,
  "pedestrian") and can be used to identify gaps in the associated dataset and
  the constructed machine-learned model.
