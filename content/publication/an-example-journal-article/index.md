abstract: "Social media platforms provide users with various ways of interacting
  with each other, such as commenting, reacting to posts, sharing content, and
  uploading pictures. Facebook is one of the most popular platforms, and its
  users frequently share and reshare posts, including research articles.
  Moreover, the reactions feature on Facebook allows users to express their
  feelings towards the content they view, providing valuable data for analysis.
  This study aims to predict the emotional impact of Facebook posts relating to
  research articles. We collected data on Facebook posts related to various
  scientific research domains, including Health Sciences, Social Sciences,
  Dentistry, Arts, and Humanities. We observed Facebook users’ reactions towards
  research articles and posts and found that ‘Like’ reactions were the most
  common. We also noticed that research articles from the Dentistry research
  domain received a lot of ‘Haha’ reactions. We used machine learning models to
  predict the sentiment of Facebook posts related to research articles. We used
  features such as the research article’s title sentiment, abstract sentiment,
  abstract length, author count, and research domain to build the models. We
  used five classifiers: Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors,
  Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes. The models were evaluated using
  accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score metrics. The Random Forest
  classifier was the best model for two- and three-class labels, achieving
  accuracy measures of 86% and 66%, respectively. We also evaluated the feature
  importance for the Random Forest model and found that the sentiment of the
  research article’s title is crucial in predicting the sentiment of the
  Facebook post. This study has substantial implications for public engagement
  in science-related messages. The emotional reactions of Facebook users towards
  research articles and posts can provide valuable insights into public
  engagement in science, and predicting the emotional impact of Facebook posts
  related to research articles can help researchers understand how the public
  perceives scientific research. The findings of the study can aid researchers
  in effectively communicating their research and engaging the public in
  scientific discourse."
