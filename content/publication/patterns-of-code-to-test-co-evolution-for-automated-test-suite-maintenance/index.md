abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) based perception algorithms
  in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles have raised major
  safety concerns due to the apparent risks to human lives. Yet assuring the
  safety of such systems is a challenging task, in a large part because ML
  components (MLCs) rarely have clearly specified requirements. Instead, they
  learn their intended tasks from the training data. One of the most
  well-studied properties that ensure the safety of MLCs is the robustness
  against small changes in images. But the range of changes considered small has
  not been systematically defined. In this paper, we propose an approach for
  specifying and testing requirements for robustness based on human perception.
  With this approach, the MLCs are required to be robust to changes that fall
  within the range defined based on human perception performance studies. We
  demonstrate the approach on a state-of-the-art object detector.
