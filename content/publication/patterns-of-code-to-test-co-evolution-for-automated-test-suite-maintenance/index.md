abstract: Software systems are characterized by continual change which often
  occurs concurrently across various artifact types. While prior work has
  focused on the evolution of individual artifacts, this paper studies the
  patterns of co-evolution between source and test code. In this research, with
  a reference to the literature, as well as our manual analysis of several
  open-source software systems we first, patternize and document common patterns
  of co-evolution between source code and test suites. Leveraging the proposed
  patterns, we further infer the necessary remedies in the test suite in
  response to source code changes. Our approach enables to add missing test
  cases to the current version of a system (augmentation), but additionally
  allows to reuse and evolve the existing test suite for a modified version of
  the system (evolution). Furthermore, identifying patterns of concurrent
  evolution provides opportunities for a bi-directional change detection and
  remediation for both artifacts, source code and test cases, and additionally
  automates the process of maintaining code-to-test trace links. The evaluation
  of the patterns and remedies in five large open-source applications indicated
  the patterns contained up to 42% of the source code changes and the
  remediation recovered up to 100% of the impacted test cases in certain cases.
