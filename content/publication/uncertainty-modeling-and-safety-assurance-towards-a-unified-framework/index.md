abstract: Uncertainty occurs naturally in software systems, including those that
  are model-based. When such systems are safety-critical, they need to be
  assured, e.g., by arguing that the system satisfies its safety goals. But how
  can we rigorously reason about assurance in the presence of uncertainty? In
  this paper, we propose a vision for a framework for managing uncertainty in
  assurance cases for software systems, and in particular, for model-based
  software systems, by systematically identifying, assessing and addressing it.
  We also discuss a set of challenges that need to be addressed to realize this
  framework.
