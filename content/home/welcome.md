Since its establishment in 2018, the Reliable AI-based Software Engineering (R-AISE) Research Lab has been a prominent center for excellence in reliable software engineering education and practical application. R-AISE is dedicated to exploring the significant intersections of Reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering (SE), commonly referred to as AI4SE. Additionally, the lab aims to develop secure and reliable engineering methodologies specifically designed for the construction of intelligent software, which is referred to as SE4AI.
