Â I'm a master's student in Computer Science at Northern Illinois University, focusing on Machine Learning and Software Engineering. I admire the power of algorithms and the way they make systems smarter. Machine Learning, which uses data to enhance these systems, is particularly interesting to me. Also, I enjoy the challenge of transforming ideas into functional software. My goal is to further develop my skills, stay up to date with technological trends, and make a valuable contribution to the field.
