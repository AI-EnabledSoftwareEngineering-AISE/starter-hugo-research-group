I'm a computer science student at Northern Illinois University, currently exploring various areas within the field to discover my passion. Artificial intelligence has caught my interest, and I've recently begun learning Python. I find it incredibly user-friendly and accessible, especially when working with AI. At AISE, I'm involved in a research project involving the comparison of code written by human to the code written by GitHub Copilot.
