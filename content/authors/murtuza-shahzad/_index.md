I love to analyze the data and draw useful insights. I specialize in ML and DL technologies. I have an affinity for Image and Text Processing using Deep Neural Networks. At SE4AI Lab, I have worked on projects related to data augmentation to improve Pedestrian detection systems. I currently work building models to predict Software vulnerabilities.
